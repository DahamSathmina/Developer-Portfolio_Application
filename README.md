# Advance-Portfolio-Application

React Developer Portfolio
 A responsive developer portfolio built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. This single-page app includes both horizontal and vertical scrolling modes, a dark/light theme toggle, and an animated particle background. Smooth section transitions and scroll-triggered animations are implemented using Framer Motion and GSAP ScrollTrigger. The site is organized into clear sections (Hero, About, Projects, Experience, Skills, Languages, Contact), making it easy to customize and navigate. Built with Vite, the dev server provides extremely fast hot-reloading and efficient builds

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or newer) and npm (or yarn) installed. It‚Äôs recommended to use Node.js ‚â•18.14.0
docs.netlify.com
 for best compatibility.
(Optional) Git if you will clone or contribute to the repo.
Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
npm install            # or 'yarn install'
Running Locally
Start the development server with hot reload:
npm run dev
Vite will spin up a local dev server (usually on http://localhost:5173) with lightning-fast HMR
vite.dev
. Open the URL in your browser to see the app live; edits in code will immediately refresh the view.
Build & Preview
To create a production build, run:
npm run build
This generates optimized files in the dist directory. By default, Vite outputs to dist
vite.dev
, which you can deploy anywhere. You can locally preview the built app with:
npm run preview
The vite preview command serves the dist files on a local server (default http://localhost:4173) so you can verify the production build
vite.dev
.
Customization Guide
Changing Section Content
Each major section (Hero, About, Projects, etc.) is a separate React component, typically found under src/sections/. To update content:
Hero/About/Experience/etc. ‚Äì Open the corresponding component file (e.g. src/sections/Hero.tsx) and edit the JSX. Change text, headings, images, and links directly in the code or in any JSON data file it uses. For example, modify the <h1> in Hero.tsx for your name/tagline, or update <p> tags in About.tsx.
Skills/Languages ‚Äì These might render from an array of skills. Look for an array or prop in the code and add/remove skills as needed.
Tip: Keep section components focused on content. If design changes are needed, update the related CSS or component props.
Adding Projects
The Projects section likely pulls data from a list. Check for a file or component (e.g. src/data/projects.ts or inside Projects.tsx) where project objects are defined. Each project entry usually includes a title, description, image (URL or import), and a link. To add a new project:
Locate the projects array, e.g.:
const projects = [
  {
    title: "My Awesome Project",
    description: "A brief description.",
    image: "/assets/project1.png",
    link: "https://github.com/yourusername/project1"
  },
  // add new projects here
];
Add a new object to this array with your project‚Äôs info.
Save and rebuild; the new project should appear in the Projects section.
If your Projects component uses props or context, follow that pattern (e.g. adding to a JSON file or state).
Particles & Theme
Particle Background: The animated canvas particles are usually implemented via a library (e.g. particles.js or tsParticles) or custom canvas code. Look for a component like Particles.tsx or code in a useEffect hook that initializes particles. Adjust parameters such as particle count, color, size, or speed in that config. For example, if using particles.js, you might see a call like particlesJS({ /* options */ }); edit the options JSON to change behavior.
Theme Styles: Dark/light mode is often managed via CSS variables or a theme context. You may find two sets of CSS variables (e.g. in :root[data-theme="light"] and :root[data-theme="dark"] in a CSS file). To change theme colors, edit these variables (like background, text, primary color). The toggle usually sets a className or data-theme on <html> or a context state. You can add new theme classes or adjust existing colors. Any change to CSS (in styles/ folder or a CSS framework config) will update the appearance.
Example: To modify primary colors, look for CSS such as --color-primary: #...; and change the hex code.
Deployment Guide
Vercel
Install the Vercel CLI (or use the Vercel web app):
npm install -g vercel
In your project root, run:
vercel
Vercel will guide you through a one-time setup. For a Vite project, Vercel automatically detects Vite and applies the correct build settings
vite.dev
.
Every time you push to your Git repo, Vercel will rebuild and deploy automatically. Alternatively, run vercel --prod to manually trigger a production deployment. Vercel‚Äôs default settings use npm run build and the dist folder (since it recognizes Vite).
Tips: No need to configure special build commands on Vercel ‚Äì it will use the Vite build by default. Ensure your repo is connected (via vercel --prod or the dashboard) for automatic CI/CD.
Netlify
Via Web UI (Git): Log in to Netlify and create a new site by linking your GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket) repo. Netlify auto-detects Vite and suggests npm run build as the build command and dist as the publish directory
docs.netlify.com
. Confirm these settings and deploy. Netlify will build and host your site on each push.
Via Netlify CLI: (Optional) You can also deploy from the command line. First install the CLI:
npm install netlify-cli -g
Then initialize or deploy:
netlify init   # creates or links to a Netlify site
netlify deploy --prod   # deploys the 'dist' folder to production
Follow the prompts to link your directory to a new site and team.
Note: Netlify handles SPAs by default, but if you use browser history routing, add a redirect rule by creating a netlify.toml or _redirects file to serve index.html for all paths.
GitHub Pages (Optional)
You can host the site on GitHub Pages using the gh-pages package and a few config steps:
Set base in vite.config.ts: If your repo is https://github.com/<USER>/<REPO>, set the base to '/<REPO>/'. For example:
// vite.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  base: '/my-portfolio/',
  // ...
});
If deploying to a user page (github.io without a repo path), you can set base: '/' or leave it default
medium.com
.
Install gh-pages:
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
Update package.json: Add the following under "scripts" (adjust repo name as needed):
{
  "homepage": "https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO>/",
  "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist",
    // other scripts...
  }
}
This tells npm to build the project then publish the dist folder to a gh-pages branch
medium.com
.
Deploy: Run:
npm run deploy
This will build the site and push the dist contents to GitHub Pages. Then in your repo‚Äôs Settings > Pages, choose the gh-pages branch as the source. Your portfolio will be live at https://<USERNAME>.github.io/<REPO>/.
See Vite‚Äôs documentation for a GitHub Actions example if you prefer an automated CI workflow.
Screenshots

Figure: Projects section (placeholder image). 

Figure: Contact section (placeholder image). (Add more screenshots for other sections as needed.)
Contributing
Contributions are welcome! To contribute:
Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
Code Style: Follow the existing code style (use TypeScript, React Hooks, and consistent formatting). If ESLint/Prettier is set up, run it before committing.
Commit messages: Write clear, descriptive commit messages.
Pull Request: Push your changes and submit a PR. Please include a description of the changes and any relevant issue numbers. If your change is large, consider opening an issue first to discuss.

Roadmap
Future improvements and features may include:
Additional Sections: E.g. a blog, testimonials, or certifications section.
CMS Integration: Allow content updates via a headless CMS or Markdown files.
Mobile Optimization: Enhanced responsiveness and touch interactions for mobile devices.
Performance: Further optimize animations and bundle size (code-splitting, image optimization).
Multi-language support: Add localization for multiple languages.
Testing: Implement unit and integration tests (using Jest, React Testing Library, etc.).
PWA Capabilities: Make the portfolio a Progressive Web App with offline support.
